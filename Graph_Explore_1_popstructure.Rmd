Comment on the graph:

The graph provides a basic overview of population structure in these 5 different countries and the world overall. It also allows us to compare between different countries, and countries with the world. If we use world as the benchmark, we can see that the countries that are more developed such as US, Japan and China has more percentage of older people and smaller percenatage of teenagers. India and South Africa comparably has heavier teenager population and lighter senior population. If their growth rate or birth rate does not change, it could have an impact on labor market in the future. With a large proportion of older people in the population and smaller proportion of teenagers, it potentially will cause shortage in labor force which could then impact the overall economy. However, to make such conclusion, we will need more detailed breakdowns of the middle group to see which tail is heavier. It makes sense to have majority of the populatin is within the range from 15 to 64 since its has the wildest range. But if we have more detailed breakdowns of this group, we can definitely analyze further and project the future impacts on workforce.
