This assignment is designed to help you get started on the final project. Be sure to review the final project instructions (https://edav.info/project.html).
    
### 1. The Team

[8 points]

a) Who's on the team? (Include names and UNIs)
 names:       UNI:
 Yue Wang     yw3576
 Haoyu Liu
 James Ding
 
b) How do you plan to divide up the work? (Grading is on a group basis. The point of asking is to encourage you to think about this and design a plan.)

  Right now, we came up with three research questions, but there will be more. Our idea is to come up with more questions related to a larger topic, and each of us will focus on one or two research questions, create graphs and provide comments. Each of us will add on to the others, communicates progress, and finally organize everything together. 

c) What is your plan for managing the git/GitHub workflow? That is, who will merge pull requests? How will you attempt to avoid conflicts? How will you communicate?


### 2. The Questions

[10 points]

List three questions that you hope you will be able to answer from your research. (It's ok if these change as your work progresses.)

a)  What are some factors that effect employment?
  
b)  How do developed countries compare with developing countries in terms of job related areas?
  
c)  How do population structures vary across different conutries?
  
### 3. GitHub repo

[8 points]

a) Set up your final project repository following the EDAVproject template. Provide the link to the repo.

https://github.com/SUN82564/5702FinalProject

b) Make sure that all team members have write access to the repository and have practiced making contributions. Provide a link to the contributors page of your repository showing that all team members have made contributions to the repo (Note that we do not have the ability to see who has write access, only contributors):
